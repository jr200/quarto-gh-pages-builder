# (main) index.qmd

setup instructions

1. setup github pages
https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html

Really just workflow / repo hygiene:

Keep branches.txt on main as the list of chapter branches only

Don’t put main or chapters in there.

Only put user chapter branches you want included in the book:

chapter1
chapter2
lng-europe
shipping-atlantic


Enforce “no merges into chapters” via GitHub settings / policy

Mark chapters as a protected branch.

Only allow maintainer pushes; don’t accept PRs into chapters from user branches.

Culturally: “You never open a PR back to chapters; you PR into main only if we ever want to promote something to infra/template.”

When a new chapter is created:

Author does:

git switch chapters
git switch -c my-new-chapter
# edit docs/, commit, push
git push -u origin my-new-chapter


You add my-new-chapter to branches.txt on main.

Now uv run book-full-build on main will see it, build it, and mount its docs under a new part: in the big book.
